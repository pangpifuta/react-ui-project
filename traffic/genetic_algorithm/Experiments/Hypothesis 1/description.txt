hypothesis 1: Optimization using sequences of timings is better than the default approaches (optimizing over entire time period with 1 sequence of timings or optimizing repeatedly over the time interval with single sequences of timings)

Experiment set 1: Using proposed approach test improvement over varying factors
	Using GA1
	Time steps = 10
	Time duration = 20 min
	individuals = 50
	Generations = 10
Experiment set 2: Optimizing over entire period
	Using GA1
	Time steps = 1
	Time duration = 20 min
	Individuals = 50
	Generations = 10
Experiment set 3:
	Using GA2
	Time steps = 10
	Time duration = 20
	Individuals = 50
	Generations = 10
